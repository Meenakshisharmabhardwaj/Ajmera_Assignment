Asp.net Core Backend Coding Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to provide Ajmera InfoTech with a candidate’s
familiarity with coding a .net core API service. API Service Description
The API service should provide restful endpoints to create and get a book entity. 
Post Entity Schema
{“name”: “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, “authorName”: “Robert Kiyosaki”, }

Get book from Id
The GET endpoint should allow for retrieval by id. The GET endpoint does not
need to allow for retrieval by any other properties. Though we asked for the
create endpoint. {“id”: “54c4e684-0a6a-449d-b445-61ddd12ffd3d”,
“name”: “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, “authorName”: “Robert Kiyosaki”
